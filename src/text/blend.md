- Blend Mode causes additional shader flushes during rendering and creates a high load
- It is better to minimize or reduce the use of Add and Mul modes to zero to reduce the temperature load
- It is necessary to use no more than two attachments with additive mode per animation
- Blend modes can only be used in announcers and special symbols (scatter, wild)
- Texture atlas reduces the number of texture switches in the render, but blends do exactly the opposite
