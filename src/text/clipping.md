- Clipping is the most expensive operation of all spine runtimes, especially if there is a mesh, and even more so with a large number of vertices
- If you can't do without clipping, make a clipping attachment with three vertices
- If you need more vertices, try to make the mask a convex polygon
- It is cheaper to add a mask in the engine, it will call one stencil shader
