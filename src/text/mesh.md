- Mesh Link reduces memory consumption, when calculating the mesh position, the values ​​previously calculated in the skeleton are reused, but this does not greatly affect the CPU load
- Deformation keys load the CPU with basic multiplication operations for each vertex, that is, the more bones affect the mesh and the more vertex it has, the greater the load. One weight and 10 vertices is about the same as three weights and three vertices. For this reason, faces and other meshes with a large number of vertices are better hung on fewer bones.
- Deformation keys eat up a lot of RAM, using a large number of deformation keys can increase the size of the skeleton
- To reduce the load on RAM, it is better to use deformation keys less often or refuse them
- It is useful to clean unnecessary mesh deformation keys with the Prune and Smooth functions
